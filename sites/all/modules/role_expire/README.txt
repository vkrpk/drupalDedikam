INTRODUCTION
------------

Role expire provides expiration to roles attached to users. Some features
available when you enable this module:

 * On the screen where admins create/edit users and assign roles (user/#/edit
   and admin/people/create), those roles can now have expiry dates.

 * A user with sufficient privilege ('administer role expire' or 'administer users')
   can view and edit roles and expiry dates.

 * On the role administration screen (admin/people/permissions/roles/edit), you
   can set a default duration for each role. The expiry duration can be a
   strtotime-compatible string (like "last day of this month").

 * Selecting a role on user_profile_form triggers a textfield (or textfields)
   where admins can enter expiration date/time for the selected role.

 * Defined expiry dates are displayed on the user's profile page, and is
   visible only to owners of the profile or users with proper permissions).

 * Actual role expiration occurs at cron time. Cron automatically removes
   expired roles from affected users.

 * You can configure a default role when each role expires (see Configuration
   section of this README file).

 * Rules module integration: One event and two actions.
